# A nuclear hybrid energy system to replace fossil fuel energy sources in Texas -- A course project
Authors: Jacob Bryan, Aiden Meek

This was a course project for Hybrid Energy Systems (MAE 5450) at Utah State University. Our goal was to design a hybrid energy system consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, and hydrogen power which could replace the coal and natural gas energy, which currently account for about 64% of electricity generation in Texas. We also took the opportunity to dip our feet in Modelica and Dymola for energy system modeling with this project.
